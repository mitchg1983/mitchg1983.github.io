<p>My name is Geoff Mitchell, welcome to my **README** file, where I ~~poorly use~~ learn how to use markdown language.</p>

<p>Currently I live in New Jersey with my wife, Ann, and our 11 year old daughter, Leah. Ann grew up in Bergen County NJ, while I'm from Massachusetts originally. I'm a veteran of the US Marine Corps, and served from 2005 - 2011. My duty station was in Hawaii and I can confirm life is beautiful out there! I also spent time in Okinawa, South Korea and two trips to the desert of Afghanistan. Below I have listed a few other "hats" I've worn over the years.</p>

    <ul>
        <li> - Backstage crew for Broadway productions </li>
        <li> - Bartender [*Check out my old bar!*](https://sm23morristown.com) </li>
        <li> - Professional Recruiter </li>
        </ul>
        
<p>I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Print Journalism from William Paterson University. When the pandemic hit I had a similar thought to many other people in the class it seems; find a solid skillset that can be worked remotely. I've always had an interest in coding, and used to write webpages in HTML when I was in highschool.</p>

Soome of my personal interests include -
<ul>
- Movies
- Cooking
- The Boston Red Sox & New England Patriots
- Hiking
- Overly complicated games that feel more like a job than entertainment
    </ul>

I will now attempt to create a definition list in markdown, my first example is this strange term for what you call a group of ferrets.

    <strong>business</strong>
    : <em>(n)</em> a group of ferrets

    <strong>
    *To Do List
    </strong>

    <form>
        <input type="checkbox" name=Find out what to call a group of ferrets. value= ? checked>
        <input type="checkbox" name=Find out why a group of ferrets is called a business. value= ?>

Here are some inspiring words to live by from Mookie Wilson, former Center Fielder for the Mets.

>When I'm in a slump, I comfort myself by saying if I believe in dinosaurs, then somewhere, they must be believing in me. And if they believe in me, then I can believe in me. Then I bust out.

## Table Time

Here we can see that the lovely Boston Red Sox hold first place in the AL East, with a 3.5 game lead over the Yankees. While I am not a professional baseball analyst, I predict that Boston will crush their opposition for the rest of the year. Every time the Yankees lose a game, an angel gets their wings. *(This is an old fairytale told to children in Massachusetts.)*



***As of 5/10/2021***

| Team | W-L | GB |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Red Sox | 22-13 | - |
| Yankees | 18-16| 3.5 |
