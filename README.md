# Hello World!
My name is Geoff Mitchell, welcome to my **README** file, where I ~~poorly use~~ learn how to use markdown language.


Currently I live in New Jersey with my wife, Ann, and our 11 year old daughter, Leah. Ann grew up in Bergen County while I'm from Massachusetts originally. I'm a veteran of the US Marine Corps and have worn a few other hats in my career

- Backstage crew for Broadway productions
- Bartender [*Check out my old bar!*](https://sm23morristown.com)
- Professional recruiter on both the agency & corporate side.

When the pandemic hit I had a similar thought to many other people in the class it seems; find a solid skillset that can be worked remotely. I've always had an interest in coding, and used to write webpages in HTML when I was in highschool.

Soome of my personal interests include -
- Movies
- Cooking
- The Red Sox & New England Patriots
- Hiking
- Overly complicated games that feel more like a job than entertainment


I will now attempt to create a definition list in markdown, my first example is this strange term for what you call a group of ferrets.

**business**
: *(n)* a group of ferrets

## Table Time

Here we can see that the lovely Boston Red Sox hold first place in the AL East, with a 3.5 game lead over the Yankees. While I am not a professional baseball analyst, I predict that Boston will crush their opposition for the rest of the year. Every time the Yankees lose a game, an angel gets their wings. *(This is an old fairytale told to children in Massachusetts.)*

***As of 5/10/2021***
| Team | W-L | GB |
