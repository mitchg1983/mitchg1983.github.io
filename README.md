# Hello World!

My name is Geoff Mitchell, welcome to my **README** file, where I *~~poorly use~~* learn how to use markdown language.

I'm a veteran of the US Marine Corps and have worn a few other hats in my career
- Backstage crew for Broadway productions
- Bartender. [*Check out my old bar!*](https://sm23morristown.com)
- Professional recruiter on both the agency & corporate side.

When the pandemic hit I had a similar thought to many other people in the class it seems; finding a solid skillset that can be worked remotely became a priority for me. I've always had an interest in coding, and used to write webpages in HTML when I was in highschool.


I will now attempt to create a definition list in markdown, my first example is this strange term for what you call a group of ferrets.
